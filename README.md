This is the walkthrough code that goes along with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRQBTkCLpFY

The main code is in `notebook.ipynb`. All the `.py` files are just helpers.

If you want to run this, you may need to install the nightly versions of `torch` and `torchvision` (as of 15 September 2021).

You'll also probably need the master branch of timm: `pip install git+https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models.git` 

Other requirements are in `requirements.txt`.
